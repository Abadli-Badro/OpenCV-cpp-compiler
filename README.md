This project is about making a **compiler** to run a **C++ OpenCV code** that reads an image and uses **thresholding**.

The compiler was made using **Flex** and **Bison** and covers:
- Lexical analysis.
- Syntax analysis.
- Semantic errors (variable types, declarations...).
- Functions.
- Some Quads.

To run this project run the commands.bat file and then run the executable on the .cpp file.
note that you need to install a **cpp compiler** and **OpenCV** for the code to work.
